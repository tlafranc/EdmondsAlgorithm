# EdmondsAlgorithm
Description:
Repository that contains the implementation of Edmonds' (or Chuâ€“Liu/Edmonds') algorithm. This algorithm solves the following problem: Given a directed graph G where each edge e has a weight w(e), find the minimum cost spanning tree from a root node r.

Running time: 
O(|V| * |E|)

Instructions For Running Program:
Compile: g++ --std=c++11 MDST.cpp -o MDST
Run: time ./MDST < *testfile*


Pecularities or Assumptions: 
1. In my program I assume that vertex #0 is the root node always.
